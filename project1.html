                    <p>Air travel is one of the most widely used forms of transportation, but it also comes with one of the most frustrating experiences for passengers: delays. Delays can disrupt travel plans, cause missed connections, and lead to increased costs for both travelers and airlines. While delays are a familiar part of flying, the reasons behind them and the ways they affect travelers are not always the same across different airports. Some delays may be due to weather, others from airline operations or air traffic control, and each type of delay can impact passengers in unique ways.</p>
                    <p>Understanding delays is important not only from the perspective of passengers who want reliable travel, but also for airlines and airports that aim to improve efficiency and reduce costs. By identifying which airports are more prone to certain types of delays, or which ones manage disruptions better, we can gain insights into how the air travel system works and where improvements might be possible.</p>

                            <strong>Are certain airports more prone to specific delay types?</strong> For example, northern airports may experience more weather-related delays in the winter, while southern airports might be more affected by thunderstorms.

                            <strong>Which airports handle delays more efficiently?</strong> This involves comparing how long delays last and identifying airports that minimize disruption versus those where delays tend to escalate.

                            <strong>What proportion of flights at each airport are delayed versus on-time?</strong> By examining delay rates, I can compare overall reliability and efficiency across different airports.
