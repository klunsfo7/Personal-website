        <h2>Research Questions</h2>
        <p>The central questions I am exploring in this project are:</p>
        <p><strong>Are certain airports more prone to specific delay types?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Which airports handle delays more efficiently, measured by fewer minutes of delay per delayed flight?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>What proportion of flights at each airport are delayed versus on-time?</strong></p>
        <p>Flight delays are a common frustration for travelers, but the causes, frequency, and severity vary widely across airports. By asking these three questions, I aim to uncover patterns in what kinds of delays occur, how severe they are, and how often they affect travelers. Together, they provide a fuller picture of how different airports perform when it comes to reliability and efficiency.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-5">Why These Questions Matter</h2>
        <p class="lead">These questions connect directly to the passenger experience of air travel. Travelers care not only about why delays happen, but also about how often they occur and how long they last when they do. For example, northern airports may face more weather-related delays, while large hubs may be more affected by carrier scheduling or air traffic congestion. At the same time, some airports might delay many flights but recover quickly, while others may delay fewer flights but keep passengers waiting much longer. Exploring these patterns sheds light on the different challenges airports face and how those challenges impact travelers.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-5">Dataset</h2>
        <p class="lead">The dataset I am using is: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sriharshaeedala/airline-delay?resource=download" target="_blank">ðŸ“Š Airline Delay Cause Dataset (Kaggle)</a></p>
        <p class="lead">It includes:</p>
        <ul class="list-group mb-5">
            <li class="list-group-item">Airport information (code + full name)</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Airline information (carrier code + name)</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Flight counts (arrivals, cancellations, diversions)</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Delay causes and minutes (carrier, weather, NAS, security, late aircraft)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lead mb-5">This makes it possible to compare airports across all three dimensions: The types of delays they experience, Their efficiency in handling delays, and The share of flights affected by delays versus those arriving on time.</p>
