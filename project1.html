        <h2>Research Question</h2>
        <p>The central question I am exploring in this project is:</p>
        <p><strong>Are certain airports more prone to specific delay types?</strong></p>
        <p>Flight delays are a common frustration for travelers, but the causes of delays vary widely. Some airports deal more with weather-related issues, while others are impacted by carrier scheduling problems or air traffic congestion. This question aims to identify whether patterns exist between airport location, size, or role (regional vs. hub) and the types of delays most frequently experienced there.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-5">Why This Question Matters</h2>
        <p class="lead">I chose this question because it connects data to a real-world experience many people have hadâ€”being stuck at an airport due to delays. By analyzing delay causes across different airports, I hope to uncover why some airports are more vulnerable to certain issues than others. For example, are northern airports more impacted by weather? Do larger hub airports struggle with carrier or airspace-related delays? Exploring these patterns may provide insights into how both geography and traffic volume affect the passenger experience.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-5">Dataset</h2>
        <p class="lead">The dataset I am using is: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sriharshaeedala/airline-delay?resource=download" target="_blank">ðŸ“Š Airline Delay Cause Dataset (Kaggle)</a></p>
        <p class="lead">The dataset includes:</p>
        <ul class="list-group mb-5">
            <li class="list-group-item">Airport information (code + full name)</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Airline information (carrier code + name)</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Flight counts (arrivals, cancellations, diversions)</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Delay causes and minutes (carrier, weather, NAS, security, late aircraft)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lead mb-5">This makes it possible to compare airports by both the volume of delays and the distribution of delay causes.</p>
