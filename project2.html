                    <p>Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death around the world, and identifying it early is essential for prevention and treatment. Doctors and researchers often rely on medical tests and patient histories to assess risk, but with the growth of machine learning, we can now ask an important question: <strong>Can we predict whether a patient has heart disease based on their medical and demographic features?</strong></p>
                    <p>This project explores that question by applying classification models to patient health data. The dataset includes a wide range of features such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, chest pain type, and exercise-induced angina that may indicate whether a patient is likely to have heart disease. By analyzing patterns in these features and training predictive models, the goal is to better understand which factors are most important and how accurately we can make such predictions.</p>
                    <p>The purpose is not only to measure model performance but also to reflect on the broader implications. If machine learning can successfully predict heart disease risk, it could be used to support early detection efforts and provide healthcare professionals with valuable tools. However, it also raises questions about accuracy, fairness, and the impact of relying on automated predictions in medical decision-making.</p>

                    <p>The dataset used for this project is the Heart Failure Prediction dataset from Kaggle, widely used in machine learning research and healthcare prediction tasks. This dataset provides a combination of medical measurements and demographic information about patients, making it ideal for exploring predictive modeling in healthcare.</p>
                    <p>Source: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction" target="_blank">Kaggle: Heart Failure Prediction</a></p>
                    <p>Each row represents an individual patient, and the target variable is <code>HeartDisease</code>, where 1 indicates the presence of heart disease and 0 indicates the absence of disease.</p>

                    <h5 class="mt-3">Why This Dataset?</h5>
                    <p>This dataset is well-suited for classification because it combines clinical indicators (blood pressure, cholesterol, ECG) with demographics (age, sex). The mix of categorical and numeric features supports meaningful preprocessing and model experimentation, and the task reflects a real-world problem with significant social and medical impact.</p>

                    <h3 class="mb-4 text-center"><strong>Pre-processing the Data</strong> <i class="bi bi-gear-fill text-success"></i></h3>
                    <p><strong>To prepare the dataset for analysis</strong>, I first loaded the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame and inspected its structure. This included checking the number of rows and columns, reviewing the column names, and verifying the data types. I also checked for missing values or duplicates that could affect later analysis.</p>
                    <p><strong>Deduplication</strong>: I removed duplicate rows to ensure that no patient records were counted more than once. Although the dataset did not contain missing values, I confirmed this by checking each column. This step was important because missing or duplicated information can bias results and reduce the reliability of the model.</p>
                    <p><strong>Encoding categorical features</strong>: Since the dataset contained both numerical and categorical features, I encoded the categorical variables so they could be used by machine learning algorithms. Features such as <em>Sex</em>, <em>ChestPainType</em>, <em>RestingECG</em>, <em>ExerciseAngina</em>, and <em>ST_Slope</em> were converted using one-hot encoding. This transformation allows each category to be represented numerically without introducing ordinal bias. For example, “Male” and “Female” in the <em>Sex</em> column were converted into binary indicator variables.</p>
                    <p><strong>Post-encoding checks</strong>: After encoding, I performed basic checks to confirm that the target variable (<code>HeartDisease</code>) remained balanced and that all features were represented correctly. This ensured that no information was lost in the transformation process and that the dataset was ready for analysis.</p>
                    <p><strong>Persisting the cleaned data</strong>: Finally, I saved the cleaned version of the dataset as a new CSV file. This ensures that all later steps in the project, including visualizations and modeling, are based on the same consistent and preprocessed data. By cleaning and encoding the dataset up front, I reduced the risk of errors and created a reliable foundation for exploring patterns and building classification models.</p>

                        <p><strong>Why I made it:</strong> Before any modeling, it’s important to understand how balanced our dataset is. If one outcome dominates the data, a model might “guess” that outcome and still appear accurate.</p>
                        <p><strong>What it shows:</strong> Both groups—patients with heart disease (1) and patients without (0)—are well represented. While not perfectly equal, there is no extreme imbalance.</p>

                        <p><strong>Why I made it:</strong> Age is a well-established risk factor; we tested whether that relationship appears in our dataset.</p>
                        <p><strong>What it shows:</strong> Patients with heart disease are, on average, older than those without. The “No Disease” group peaks more in younger decades.</p>

                        <p><strong>Why I made it:</strong> MaxHR reflects cardiovascular capacity; we checked whether it separates the two groups.</p>
                        <p><strong>What it shows:</strong> Patients with heart disease tend to achieve lower MaxHR, while those without reach higher values; medians and spreads differ.</p>

                        <p><strong>What it shows:</strong> There’s overlap, but patients with heart disease generally have slightly higher cholesterol; weaker than MaxHR/Oldpeak but a trend exists.</p>
